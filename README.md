# Apollo-13kb

Join the crew of the unlucky Apollo-13 mission to the moon in this simplified historical simulation. Listen for commands from Mission Control, and control the spacecraft by simply pushing buttons. Keep the crew alive, and bring them home to Earth.

> On April 11, 1970 at 13:13, the 13th
Apollo mission was launched.
>
> Two days later the three astronauts
are headed towards the moon...

## Postmortem

The jam's theme was *Triskaidekaphobia*, the fear of the number 13. For a while I was batting around an idea for a city-builder game, utilizing a stacked sprite technique I developed for [Nomads' Fire](https://deathray.itch.io/nomads-fire). I was going to have a catastrophe hit the city whenever a building grew to floor 13. But the more I thought it over, and the more days went by without coding (due to vacation and just life's demands), the more I realized I needed something more simple. Although this jam is a month long, I really only started working on the game in the last five days.

Somehow I stumbled on the idea of using: [The Apollo 13 mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13), and the entire Apollo Program, as inspiration. I wasn't sure how close to history I would stick, but as I poured through the wikipedia page, and other articles, I found myself drawn to the story as it really happened. Also as luck would have it, right as I was in the middle of coding this, Netflix released a new documentary ["Apollo 13 Survival"](https://www.netflix.com/title/81444292), which I had to instantly watch.

In many ways this is a spiritual successor to *"[Return to the Moon](https://github.com/deathraygames/lunar-lander-13k)"*, aka. "Lunar Lander 13k" ([play](https://deathraygames.github.io/lunar-lander-13k/src/)). I used a similar art style - vector lines on a dark background. The gameplay is very different though: simple clicking versus *Return's* arcade-like experience. I really like the simplicity and scalability of working with SVGs, and the line drawings remind me of spacecraft diagrams.

I originally wanted all the controls to be inside the SVG, but that seemed too complicated, so I went with a simple dialog for each part, containing some info and a few buttons. It seems I accidentally ended up adapting perhaps the dullest interface of Kerbal Space Program.

I also took one technique from [Oxygen Levels Critical](https://github.com/deathraygames/oxygen-levels-critical) ([play](https://deathraygames.github.io/oxygen-levels-critical/)): Using the browser's [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis). So much of the charm of the old Apollo missions is from listening to the comms chatter between Mission Control and the astronauts, and having voices talking added a little bit more charm to the otherwise dull game.
